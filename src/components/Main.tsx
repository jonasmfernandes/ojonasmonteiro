          I'm a software engineer with over 2 years of experience specializing
          in accessible, pixel-perfect interfaces. I combine design and
          development to create seamless user experiences. I refine my skills
          through side projects and engage a 75k+ community of aspiring
          developers, bridging frontend, UX, and design.

          When I'm not coding, you'll find me drawing digital art and watching
          anime â€“ which actually inspires a lot of my UI design aesthetics. I
          believe that bringing together my passion for art and technology helps
          me create more engaging and visually appealing web experiences.
